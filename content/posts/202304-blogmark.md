This post is a collection of interesting blogs and findings in the internet about quality engineering, software analytics and other software engineering (leadership) related topics.

#### Software Analytics

What is "Software Analytics"? Tim Menzies & Thomas Zimmermann defined it as "Software analytics is analytics on software data for managers and software engineers with the aim of empowering software development individuals and teams to gain and share insight from their data to make better decisions."

#### Agile Testing Days Sketchnotes

Especilly the sketchnote about the talk "Refining your Test Automation Approach in modern contexts" caught my attention because 
I'm seeing as well that in Test automation today are very similiar challenges than 10 years ago.
