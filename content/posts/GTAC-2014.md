I'm happy to announce that I will give a lightning talk at Google's Test Automation Conference (GTAC) about selendroid.
The schedule of this year's conference you find [here](https://developers.google.com/google-test-automation-conference/2014/schedule)

In the mean while I have written together with [Michael Palotas](https://twitter.com/michael_palotas) an article about `Mobile Test Automation with Selendroid` in the [Methods and Tools Magazine](http://www.methodsandtools.com/tools/selendroid.php).
