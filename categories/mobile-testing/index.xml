      <description>Yesterday and today I attended the Google Developer Group (GDG) DevFest in Zürich and I really enjoyed it! I have seen good presentations, met really nice people and I had great discussions. This afternoon I did a presentation about how to automate native Android apps using Calabash-Driver and how to leverage an existing Selenium Grid2 architecture to allow scaling and parallel testing.
Here you find my slides of today&amp;rsquo;s presentation:</description>

      <description>In my previous post I blogged about open source frameworks for mobile end-to-end testing and in the other past post I described about how to setup the Greenhouse sample app environment.
In this post I would like to describe how to test an Android app with Calabash-Android, which was open sourced in the beginning of March.
The basic architecture of Calabash is described in this figure, which I have taken from the Less Painful homepage:</description>

      <description>Via Twitter I found the camholder (http://camholder.org), which can be used to
 &amp;hellip; present your mobile content right on your device – with all it&amp;rsquo;s sensors! The HD camera and the (optional) Mac Software are proven to work on stage for your best live performance.
 So I ordered one and some days ago the Camholder was delivered and I&amp;rsquo;m really happy that I ordered one. I&amp;rsquo;m planning to use the CamHolder in presentation and as well during the day to day work because the team I&amp;rsquo;m part of is distributed around Europe.</description>
