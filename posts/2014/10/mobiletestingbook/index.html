          <p>Yesterday <a href="http://www.adventuresinqa.com/">Daniel Knott</a> announced that he has published his book <code>Hands-On Mobile App Testing</code>.</p>

<p>Daniel writes on his book page: &ldquo;This book is aimed at anyone interested in mobile apps and mobile testing, ranging from junior to expert mobile testers who are already involved in mobile development teams. This book is also ideal for software test managers who need to manage mobile testing teams or to select a mobile test strategy. Itâ€™s also great for software testers who are new to this topic and want to switch to mobile technologies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was able to give early feedback and I can recommend the book to all mobile testers!</p>
